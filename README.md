Created custom directive that can :-<br/>
a) slide down or up, the element in all the 4 directions(top,bottom,left,right).<br/>
b) achieving transition in background application from all the 4 directions(top,bottom,left,right).<br/>

<p align="center">
    <img  alt="component" src="img/img.png"/>

# Getting Started:-
The component along with the buttons(Reset,Animate) can be reused or alone the component can be reused.


# Technologies used:-
